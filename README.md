# TweetClassifier: NLP-Driven Demographic Profiling

## Introduction

TweetClassifier is a research initiative exploring the feasibility of deducing demographic data such as gender and age from Twitter content. This project serves as a foundational study with potential implications for targeted marketing and audience understanding.

### -- Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Objective
- **Demographic Inference**: Experiment with NLP models to infer user demographics from tweets.
- **Methodological Framework**: Develop a preliminary methodology for data collection, labeling, and analysis to set the stage for future product development.

## Partner

Gratitude is extended to Intuition Intelligence Inc. and San Francisco State University, with a special nod to Prof. Cheung & Ozsen, for their invaluable contributions to this exploratory study.

## Technologies and Methods

The study utilized Python, Twitter API, Tweepy, BERT, and a two-layer stacking model approach. The first layer of the model consists of various basic classifiers (weak learners), and the second layer combines their outputs to enhance prediction accuracy, demonstrating the potential for a scalable demographic prediction model.
